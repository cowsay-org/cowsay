 cowsay is distributed under the same licensing terms as Perl: the
 Artistic License or the GNU General Public License.  If you don't
 want to track down these licenses and read them for yourself, use
 the parts that I'd prefer:
 .
 (0) I wrote it and you didn't.
 .
 (1) Give credit where credit is due if you borrow the code for some
 other purpose.
 .
 (2) If you have any bugfixes or suggestions, please notify me so
 that I may incorporate them.
 .
 (3) If you try to make money off of cowsay, you suck.
