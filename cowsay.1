.SH "NAME"
cowsay, cowthink \- configurable speaking/thinking cow (and a bit more)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcowsay\fR [\fB\-e\fR \fIeye_string\fR] [\fB\-f\fR \fIcowfile\fR | \fB\-r\fR [\fB\-C\fR] ] [\fB\-h\fR] [\fB\-l\fR] [\fB\-n\fR] [\fB\-T\fR \fItongue_string\fR] [\fB\-W\fR \fIcolumn\fR] [\fB\-bdgpstwy\fR] [<message>]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fICowsay\fR generates an ASCII picture of a cow saying something provided by the user\&. If run with no arguments, it accepts standard input, word\-wraps the message given at about 40 columns, and prints the cow saying the given message on standard output\&.
.sp
To aid in the use of arbitrary messages with arbitrary whitespace, use the \fB\-n\fR option\&. If it is specified, the given message will not be word\-wrapped\&. This is possibly useful if you want to make the cow think or speak in figlet(6)\&. If \fB\-n\fR is specified, there must not be any command line arguments left after all the switches have been processed\&.
.sp
The \fB\-W\fR specifies roughly where the message should be wrapped\&. The default is equivalent to \fB\-W 40\fR (i\&.e\&. wrap words at or before the 40th column)\&.
.sp
If any command\-line arguments are left over after all switches have been processed, they become the cow\(cqs message\&. The program will not accept standard input for a message in this case\&.
.sp
If the program is invoked as \fBcowthink\fR then the cow will think its message instead of saying it\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
There are several provided modes which change the appearance of the cow depending on its particular emotional/physical state\&.
.SS "Cow modification"
.PP
\fB\-b\fR
.RS 4
Invokes Borg mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Causes the cow to appear dead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g\fR
.RS 4
Invokes greedy mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Causes a state of paranoia to come over the cow\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
Makes the cow appear thoroughly stoned\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR
.RS 4
Yields a tired cow\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR
.RS 4
Is somewhat the opposite of
\fB\-t\fR, and initiates wired mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-y\fR
.RS 4
Brings on the cow\(cqs youthful appearance\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR
.RS 4
Selects the appearance of the cow\(cqs eyes, in which case the first two characters of the argument string
\fIeye_string\fR
will be used\&. The default eyes are
\fBoo\fR\&. The tongue is similarly configurable through
\fB\-T\fR
and
\fItongue_string\fR; it must be two characters and does not appear by default\&. However, it does appear in the
\fIdead\fR
and
\fIstoned\fR
modes\&. Any configuration done by
\fB\-e\fR
and
\fB\-T\fR
will be lost if one of the provided modes is used\&.
.RE
.SS "Cow selection"
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a particular cow picture file (\fIcowfile\fR) to use\&. If the cowfile spec resolves to an existing file, then it will be interpreted as a path to the cowfile\&. Otherwise, cowsay will search the COWPATH for a cowfile with that name\&. Additional cowpath entries may be specified in the
\fBCOWPATH\fR
environment variable\&. To list all cowfiles on the current
\fBCOWPATH\fR, invoke
\fBcowsay\fR
with the
\fB\-l\fR
switch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Chooses a random cow from the cows on the
\fBCOWPATH\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR
.RS 4
Enables true\-color (24\-bit) cows\&. Currently only has an effect when used in conjunction with
\fB\-r\fR\&.
.RE
.SS "Non\-cow operations"
.PP
\fB\-l\fR
.RS 4
Lists the defined cows on the current
\fBCOWPATH\fR\&. Displays it in a human\-readable pretty\-printed format when displaying to a terminal device\&. When sent to a non\-terminal device, outputs the list in a parsing\-friendly format with one cow name per line and no headers or blank lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Displays a help screen\&.
.RE
.SH "COWFILE FORMAT"
.sp
A cowfile is made up of a simple block of \fBperl(1)\fR code, which assigns a picture of a cow to the variable \fB$the_cow\fR\&. Should you wish to customize the eyes or the tongue of the cow, then the variables \fB$eyes\fR and \fB$tongue\fR may be used\&. The trail leading up to the cow\(cqs message balloon is composed of the character(s) in the \fB$thoughts\fR variable\&. Any backslashes must be reduplicated to prevent interpretation\&. Also, at\-signs ("@") must be backslashed because that is what Perl 5 expects\&. The name of a cowfile must end with \fB\&.cow\fR, otherwise it is not recognized as a cowfile\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
The \fBCOWPATH\fR environment variable, if present, will be used to search for cowfiles\&. It contains a colon\-separated list of directories, much like \fBPATH\fR or \fBMANPATH\fR\&.
.sp
The default \fBCOWPATH\fR is searched after entries in the user\-specified \fBCOWPATH\fR environment variable\&. To suppress this behavior (e\&.g\&. for development work), set the \fBCOWSAY_ONLY_COWPATH\fR environment variable to \fB1\fR\&. In this case, \fBCOWPATH\fR should contain at least a directory with a file called \fBdefault\&.cow\fR in it\&.
.SH "FILES"
.sp
\fB%PREFIX%/share/cowsay/cows\fR holds a sample set of cowfiles\&. Your \fBCOWPATH\fR automatically contains this directory, unless \fBCOWSAY_ONLY_COWPATH\fR is set to \fB1\fR\&.
.sp
\fB%PREFIX%/share/cowsay/site\-cows\fR is provided for administrators to install custom cows\&. Cows in \fBshare/cowsay/site\-cows\fR take precedence over cows with the same name in \fBshare/cowsay/cows\fR\&. The \fBsite\-cows\fR directory will never be modified by cowsay installations, so custom cows defined there will persist across upgrades of cowsay\&. \fBsite\-cows\fR is also on the default \fBCOWPATH\fR\&.
.sp
\fB%PREFIX%/etc/cowsay/cowpath\&.d/\fR (or \fB/etc/cowsay/cowpath\&.d/\fR when %PREFIX% is \fB/usr\fR) is a directory that contains files which list entries to be added to the default \fBCOWPATH\fR\&. This mechanism allows third\-party cow collections to register themselves with cowsay in a way that does not require per\-user configuration\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
