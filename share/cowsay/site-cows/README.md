The cowsay `site-cows/` directory
=================================

You can drop your local site specific cow files into this directory.

To distribute your own cows, we recommend you use the `cowpath.d`
mechanism to extend the cowpath.

Any file type and file name supported by the `cowsay(1)` command will
work.
