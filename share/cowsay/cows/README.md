The cowsay `cows/` directory
============================

This directory is where `cowsay` keeps its own cows.

While you can technically drop your own cow files here, it is
recommended that you use the `site-cows/` directory to keep your own
local cow files, and use the `cowpath.d` mechanism to extend the
cowpath if you distribute your own cows.

Any file type and file name supported by the `cowsay(1)` command will
work.
