The exact licensing situation is a little unclear here, and clarifying it is an ongoing project. You may use the entirety of the Cowsay distribution under "GNU GPL 3 or later" terms. If you want to use the other GNU GPL 1, GNU GPL 2, or Artistic License terms, you may need to do research to determine which files are actually licensed under those terms.
